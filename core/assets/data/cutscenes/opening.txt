Mayor|As you are no doubt aware, our fair village of Lagos has been on hard times.
Mayor|Bandits are raiding, Slimes wreck our farms, and who knows what else is out there, scheming to prey upon us.
Mayor|And although many villages have their own guards and guilds to keep the peace, we have none.
Mayor|I have called everyone here today to decide who to volunteer to protect our village.
|...
Farmer Guy|Not it.
Farmer Girl|Not it.
Shopkeeper|Not me either.
Alchemist|I nominate $player! Without a job, an education, or parents, $player is a perfect candidate!
$player|... What?
Farmer Guy|Sounds good to me!
$player|Hold on, don't I get a say in this?
Mayor|Sure. All in favor say aye!
Shopkeeper|Aye
Farmer Girl|Aye
Mayor|Aye
$player|... Nay?
Mayor|Welp, majority wins. Congratulations, $player. Here's some cash, go to the Guild Hall to turn in your application.

Guild Associate|Hello there. What are you here for today?
$player|... Ah, I'm here to create a new guild?
Guild Associate|Ah, splendid! Please submit your application and resume, and we’ll get you started.
$player|I need a resume?
Guild Associate|Ahaha, just messing with you, kid!
Guild Associate|No one who starts a guild has a resume worth anything anyways! Just write down your name and what you want to guild to be called, and we’ll get started.
!textinput guildname "What is your guild's name?"
!saveedit guildname $guildname
Guild Associate|Perfect, $guildname, is it? I’ll have it registered as a new D-Rank Guild, as soon as you demonstrate that you can accomplish some simple tasks.
Guild Associate|Quite frankly, there’s a lot of people that just assume that registering a guild means that they can go slay dragons or whatever… so we have some standards nowadays.
Guild Associate|All you have to do is enter the nearby forest and bring back the key item in the chest near the back of the first area.
$player|That sounds simple enough.
Guild Associate|You’d think that, but if you want to survive, I highly recommend you not go by yourself. Wouldn’t want our new payche-, I mean, guild, to become defunct on the first day, y’know?
$player|Alright, how would you recruit new members?
Guild Associate|I dunno, that’s your problem, yeah? Maybe just go to the local orphanage and recruit some impressionable kids, hahaha!
$player|Ugh...

Mayor|Ah, excellent! I see you have registered your guild already.
Mayor|I have some good news for you.
Mayor|I took out a loan in your name so that your new guild can have a place to be!
Mayor|Don’t worry about the size of the loan, I’m sure that you’ll do good work and pay it back!
$player|Wait, what?!
Mayor|Anyways, the village is relying on you! Good luck!
